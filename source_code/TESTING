* many of these use UberFTP

1) Installation documenation. Need to update INSTALL and post updates to wiki.

2) Directory listing testing. Type, size, owner, group, recursive,
   large directories (over 200 entries).

3) Full file stor of various sizes. Checksum comparison for validation.
	a) set debug mode: "debug"
	b) turn on markers: "quote opts 'retr markers=1\;'"
	c) turn on extended block mode: "mode e"
	d) store files of various sizes. Should see:
		*) constant perf + restart markers if perf marker patch not installed
		*) constant perf markers + final restart marker if perf marker patch installed
	e) compute checksum for comparison: "quote cksm md5 0 -1 <file>"

4) Full file retr of various sizes. Checksum comparison for validation.
	* Note, no markers on retrive.
	a) retrieve files of various sizes.
	b) compute checksum for comparison: "quote cksm md5 0 -1 <file>"

** Add partial, append and restart tests in stream and extended block mode

5) Checksums in UDA and markers. With config option set to on:
    a) store 'large' file. 'large' meaning checkum requires many 10s of seconds
       to compute.
	b) enable debug mode: "debug"
	c) enable checksum markers: "quote opts 'cksm markers=1\;'"
    d) compute checksum, should see progress markers. Compare final checksum.
	e) repeat (d) for same file, checksum should be returned immediatelly.

6) Checksums not in UDA and markers. WIth config option set to off:
	a) perform test #5 again. (e) should not be immediate.
