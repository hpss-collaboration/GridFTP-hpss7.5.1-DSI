# Format of this file is:
#  Key Value
#  No spaces except between Key and Value

# (required) Name of the HPSS user in the keytab file that the GridFTP
# server will use to authenticate to HPSS
LoginName gridftp

# (required) AuthenticationMech
# Defines the type of authentication that the DSI will perform when logging 
# into HPSS. Note that this is not the authentication mechanism the GridFTP
# users will use; they always use GSI. Valid options are "unix", "krb5", "gsi"
# and "spkm".
AuthenticationMech unix

# (required) Authenticator
# used with AuthenticationMech to perform the authentication to HPSS. Format is:

Authenticator auth_keytab:/var/hpss/etc/gridftp.keytab

# (optional) QuotaSupport
# used when using NCSA's quota system. Turning this on causes renamed files to
# be marked with UDAs so that they can be found later and have the quota information
# updated. The value is not case sensitive. The default is off.

# (optional) UDAChecksumSupport
# Causes checksums to be stored automatically within UDAs so that the checksum
# can be recalled later without bring the file back from tape. The value is not
